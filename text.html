    <title>The power of music through the decades</title>
    <!-- My website will be solely focasing on the different genres of music and the power of music overall -->

         <h1>What is music?</h1>

      <p>define<b> Music </b>The official definition of music states that music is a vocal or  
        instrumental sound (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, 
        harmony, and expression of emotion. The word music comes from the Greek word (mousike), 
        which means "(art) of the Muses". Music is a form of art; an expression of emotions through 
        harmonic frequencies. The definition of music can be different depending on a person's perspective 
        or view on it. For each individual, music may represent something different, which makes the actual
        definition of music go way deeper than just words. A written difinition is one thing but the experience
        of actually listening to music and feeling the emotion and frequency of the art of music is where the
        true definition resides to each individual.</p>
    
    <h2>What decades will we talk about?</h2>

    <p>Music has changed dramatically through the years. Throughout the years, musical styles have reflected
         the society of the time and have evolved with changes in the world. Not only does music change with
         society but it changes with technological advances as well. As technology changes it can allow new 
         styles to emerge and new ways for people to listen. Music trends change constantly day by day, so 
         to understand where all of this started and where some music genres were at their peak, I have created
         a list of what genres of music define each decade.</p>

         <h3>Why is Music so important?</h3>
         <p> Music is an important part of our life as it is a way of expressing our feelings as well as
         emotions. In the course of history, music is the greatest creation of mankind. Creativity in the
         pure and undiluted form is the true definition of Music.  Music plays a more important role in our
         life than just being a source of entertainment. Music gives us a way to express ourselves and show
         how we feel inside ourselves that we don't usually let people see. Music is important in our world,
         as well as in our lives, and here are some reasons why.</p>
          <ul>
         <li>A way of expression</li>
         <li>Communicating how we feel</li>
         <li>Bringing people together</li>
         <li>Help cope with emotions</li>
         <li>Entertainment</li>
         <li>Soothe depression/sadness</li>
         <li>inspiring/modivational</li>
         </ul>
         <blockquote>"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and 
             life to everything."</blockquote>
